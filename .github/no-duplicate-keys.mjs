/**
 * Rejects duplicate keys in the workflow files.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A duplicate key inside a YAML mapping is a **syntax error for GitHub Actions
 * and invisible to a YAML parser**. PyYAML, `yq`, and every other reader used
 * here keep the *last* value and say nothing, so a duplicated `IMAGE_TAG:` sat in
 * `ci.yml` from PR #21 and was invisible to every local check.
 *
 * The visible effect was not subtle either, once you knew to look for it: the
 * whole workflow stopped being scheduled. Every `ci` run on `main` reported
 * `failure` with **zero jobs** and a duration of 0s — which reads, if you do not
 * know the signature, like an infrastructure outage rather than a file GitHub
 * refused to parse. `capability` kept passing throughout, because it is a
 * different file.
 *
 * So: the check that would have caught it is this one, and it runs in CI on the
 * same commit as the workflows.
 *
 * ## Copied from the backend repository, and why
 *
 * The outage described above happened in
 * `microsoft-onenote-exporter-web-backend`. Copying the script rather than
 * solving it twice is deliberate: the failure mode is a *duplicate key*, which a
 * parser accepts silently, so the check has to be the text scanner either way. Two
 * copies of a 130-line scanner will drift, and this one has no dependencies and no
 * configuration, so the cost of the copy is one file.
 *
 * The header on the copy should keep pointing at the original incident: the date
 * and the repository are what make the check recognisable later.
 *
 * ## Why a text scanner and not a parser
 *
 * Because the parse is what loses the information. Reading the file with a YAML
 * library gives one value per key and no way to learn there were two, which is
 * the whole question. So the source is scanned as text.
 *
 * That is only safe if the scanner understands the two things in a workflow file
 * that are not YAML mappings:
 *
 *   - **block scalars.** Everything under `run: |` is a shell script, and a shell
 *     script legitimately contains `FOO: bar` twice. Those lines are skipped, and
 *     the scanner tracks the `run:` line's indentation to know where the block
 *     ends.
 *   - **sibling scope.** Only *consecutive* keys at the same indentation are
 *     siblings. A key repeated in a different mapping is not a duplicate, so the
 *     key set resets whenever the indentation changes in either direction. An
 *     earlier version of this file only reset on a *decrease*, which meant it
 *     skipped the very lines it was looking for — the keys under `env:` are
 *     indented deeper than `env:` itself — and passed on a file that still had
 *     the defect.
